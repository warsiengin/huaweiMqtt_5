## About

Reads data from your Huawei inverter via Modbus TCP and publishes it via MQTT  
with automatic Home Assistant discovery.

## Features

- **Batch Reading Mode** — reduces cycle time by up to 75% on high-latency networks
- **66 Essential Registers** for complete inverter monitoring
- **Automatic Slave ID Detection** — tries common values (1, 2, 100) automatically
- **Total Increasing Filter** — prevents false counter resets, active from first cycle
- **Intelligent error tracking** with downtime aggregation and recovery logging
- **MQTT Auto-Discovery** — all entities appear automatically under a single device
- **Auto MQTT credentials** — uses Home Assistant MQTT Service by default
- **Comprehensive test suite** — 93% coverage with unit, integration, and E2E tests
- **Batch Reading Mode** (optional) — up to 75% faster Modbus cycles with automatic fallback to sequential mode
- **Multi-architecture support** (aarch64, amd64, armhf, armv7, i386)
- **Performance**: ~2-5s read cycle, configurable poll interval (30-60s recommended)
