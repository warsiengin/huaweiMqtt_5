# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.11.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- **`get_error_tracker()`** accessor function: Exposes the module-level `_error_tracker` singleton for testing and integration diagnostics (closes coverage gap for the `ErrorTracker` reset path).
- **`test_get_error_tracker_returns_module_singleton`**: Unit test verifying that `get_error_tracker()` returns the same `ErrorTracker` instance across calls.
- **`test_get_error_tracker_reflects_reset_state`**: Unit test verifying that the tracker state reflects resets (downtime counters, error counts).

### Changed

- **huawei-solar library upgrade 2.5.0 -> 3.0.7**: Migration from `pyModbus` to `tModbus` as transport layer. `AsyncHuaweiSolar.create()` changed to `create_tcp_client()` + `await client.connect()`. `client.stop()` changed to `client.disconnect()`. Exception handling switched from `pymodbus.exceptions` to `huawei_solar.exceptions` (`ReadException`, `ConnectionException`, `ConnectionInterruptedException`).
- **Narrowed exception handling in `read_registers()`**: Bare `except Exception` replaced with `READ_EXCEPTIONS` (ReadException, TimeoutError, connection errors, AttributeError). Programming errors (TypeError, KeyError, etc.) now propagate instead of triggering silent sequential fallback. This is an intentional behavioral change: `build_batches()` is pure-Python batch construction that should fail fast on programming errors, not silently degrade.
- **Error type categorization**: Introduced `ErrorType` Literal (`connection_exception`, `connection_interrupted`) in `error_tracker.py` for canonical error type mapping.
- **Code quality refactors** (no functional change):
  - `error_tracker` privatized to `_error_tracker` with `get_error_tracker()` accessor (CC-CLEAN-001).
  - Extracted `_read_single_register()` helper to eliminate duplicated try/except blocks (CC-CLEAN-003).
  - `ConfigurationError` raised by `determine_slave_id()` instead of `sys.exit(1)`, enabling testability (HA-ASYNC-002).
  - `setup_mqtt()` and `setup_modbus()` narrowed `except Exception` to `except (OSError, ConnectionError)` (CC-CLEAN-002).
- **Test coverage**: 93.23% → 93.33% (0.10% absolute improvement from error-tracker accessor tests).

### Fixed

- **Pyright import path**: Corrected `RegisterDefinition` import path (`huawei_solar.register_definitions.base`).
- **`CallbackAPIVersion` import**: Moved from `paho.mqtt.client` to `paho.mqtt.enums` (fixes `reportPrivateImportUsage`).
- **Register name mapping**: Fixed `storage_unit_1_soc`/`storage_unit_2_soc`/`storage_unit_3_soc` to use correct library API names `storage_unit_1_state_of_capacity`/`storage_unit_2_state_of_capacity`. `storage_unit_3` has no library equivalent and was removed.
- **Smart batching stability**: Smart-batched Modbus reads now split batches that would exceed the Modbus FC03/FC04 hard limit of 125 registers per read (address span measured as last register end minus first register start). This prevents the `ValueError: Quantity must be between 1 and 125.` from the underlying tModbus PDU constructor. A local `ValueError` safety-net in `read_registers()` falls back to sequential single-register reads when an oversized batch slips through, preventing fatal bridge termination.

### Dependencies

**Removed:** `pymodbus`, `backoff`, `pyserial-asyncio`, `pyserial`, `pytz`
**Added:** `tmodbus`, `serialx`, `tenacity`

## [1.10.4]

### Fixed

- **Modbus connect timeout**: `setup_modbus()` now wraps `AsyncHuaweiSolar.create()` in `asyncio.wait_for()` with a 15-second timeout, preventing indefinite hangs when the TCP handshake stalls. Previously only the slave-ID auto-detection path had a timeout; the final connection create call was unbounded (HA-ASYNC-001).

### Changed

- **Narrowed exception handlers in `run_main_cycle`**: Replaced broad `except Exception` catch-all with explicit `RECOVERABLE_EXCEPTIONS` tuple (`TimeoutError`, `ConnectionRefusedError`, `ModbusException`). `ExceptionResponse` from pymodbus 3.x is excluded at runtime since it is a data class, not a `BaseException` subclass. Truly unexpected errors now propagate to the top-level `main()` handler instead of being silently swallowed. `asyncio.CancelledError` is explicitly re-raised (CC-CLEAN-002).
- **Typed error categories**: Introduced `ErrorType` Literal (`"timeout"`, `"connection_refused"`, `"modbus_exception"`) in `error_tracker.py`. Replaced `type(e).__name__.lower()` stringification (which produced inconsistent names like `"timeouterror"`) with explicit canonical error type mapping (PY-STYLE-003).

## [1.10.3] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- **Async safety in MQTT hotpath**: `publish_data()` and `publish_status()` no longer block the event loop with synchronous `wait_for_publish()` calls. Both functions now offload the blocking paho-mqtt wait to `loop.run_in_executor()`.
- **Startup connection polling**: `connect_mqtt()` no longer uses a busy-poll loop with `time.sleep(0.1)` to wait for the MQTT callback. Replaced with `threading.Event` + `run_in_executor()` — the correct primitive since paho callbacks run in their own thread.
- **Shutdown cleanup**: `disconnect_mqtt()` is now async; `loop_stop()` and `disconnect()` run in an executor instead of blocking shutdown.

### Changed

- **`myPy` compliance**: Added `# type: ignore[attr-defined]` for paho-mqtt `CallbackAPIVersion.VERSION2` to resolve type-checker false positive.
- **Dependency sync**: `requirements.txt` regenerated from `uv.lock` with pinned versions `pymodbus==3.13.1` and `pytz==2026.2`.

## [1.10.2] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed
- **Runtime state encapsulation**: Replaced scattered globals (`LAST_SUCCESS`, `BATCH_MODE_AVAILABLE`) with `_BridgeState` and a dedicated `reset_state()` helper for tests.
- **Poll interval enforcement**: Moved cycle wait handling into the main loop path and preserved the existing `poll_interval` timing behavior.
- **Modbus auto-detection cleanup**: `client.stop()` during failed slave-ID attempts is now bounded by `asyncio.wait_for(..., timeout=2.0)` and cleanup failures are logged instead of silently swallowed.
- **Filter reset behavior**: `reset_filter()` now resets the singleton state without destroying the instance, avoiding repeated singleton recreation during error recovery.
- **TRACE logger typing**: Replaced dynamic monkey-patching with a dedicated `_TraceLogger` subclass.

### Changed
- **Default `batch_max_gap` remains reduced to 50**: Keeps Batch 3 below the inverter's internal register limit after the 1.10.1 adjustment.
- **Runtime dependency export**: `requirements.txt` is now generated by `uv export --no-dev --no-hashes --no-emit-project` and includes transitive runtime dependencies.
- **Development dependency management**: Migrated dev dependencies from optional dependencies to PEP 735 `[dependency-groups]`.
- **CI dependency resolution**: CI uses `uv sync --dev` and Docker generation uses `--no-emit-project`.
- **CI actions**: Updated GitHub Actions and `astral-sh/setup-uv`.
- **Production push script**: Removed dev-only local/update-test scripts from the production push summary and added a `requirements.txt` guard.

### Tests
- Added `tests/test_version.py` to verify the bridge version constant.
- Expanded BATS coverage for `enable_batching` and `batch_max_gap` environment handling.
- Refactored test suite around the new runtime state helpers and dependency group setup.

## [1.10.1] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed
- **Default `batch_max_gap` reduced from 100 to 50**: The previous default caused
  Batch 3 to exceed the inverter's internal register limit (125), triggering a
  sequential fallback on every cycle. With 50, registers are split into smaller
  batches that stay within the limit. Users with `batch_max_gap: 100` in their
  config should update to `50`.

### Improved
- Clearer log message when a batch exceeds the inverter limit, with a hint to
  reduce `batch_max_gap`.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- **Smart Batch Grouping**: New `enable_batching` and `batch_max_gap` configuration options
  - `enable_batching` (default: `true`): Enable intelligent grouping of registers by Modbus address proximity
  - `batch_max_gap` (default: `100`): Maximum address gap (in Modbus units) within a batch
  - Reduces TCP calls from 66 individual reads to typically 3-5 batch requests
  - Automatically groups related registers together to optimize network utilization
  - Falls back gracefully to sequential reads if batching fails
  - Configurable per-deployment to tune for specific network conditions

- **Batch Builder Module**: New `batch_builder.py` for intelligent register batching
  - `BatchBuilder` class for grouping registers by Modbus address proximity
  - Smart fallback strategies for handling problematic register combinations
  - Extensible design for future optimization (actual Modbus address mapping)

### Tests

- Added `test_batch_builder.py` with comprehensive tests for batch building logic (15 tests)
- Added `test_read_registers_smart_batching_enabled` to verify smart batching groups registers
- Extended `test_main.py` to verify batching behavior with new tuple-based API
- Extended configuration loading tests to include new batch configuration options (`enable_batching`, `batch_max_gap`)

### Performance Impact

- **Typical case** (smart batching + standard network): 17.4s → 3.9-6.7s per cycle (77% reduction)
- **With optimization**: 15.1s → 4.4s warm-up, then stabilizes at 3.9s (74% reduction)
- **Fallback** (on batch errors): Still benefits from partial grouping (not all-or-nothing)

## [1.9.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added

- **Performance Diagnostics**: Detailed per-register timing measurements when `log_level: DEBUG` is enabled
  - Individual register read times with warnings for slow registers (>200ms)
  - Statistical analysis: average, min, max, and median timing across all registers
  - Top 5 slowest registers listed in logs to identify performance bottlenecks
  - Connection establishment time logging with detailed host/port/slave information
  - Helps diagnose network latency issues and SDongle firmware performance variations
- **Documentation**: Expanded Performance Troubleshooting section in DOCS.md with:
  - Step-by-step diagnosis guide for slow cycle times
  - Network latency testing instructions (ping, traceroute)
  - Expected vs. problematic performance metrics
  - Firmware update recommendations and caveats

### Tests

- Added `test_read_registers_timing_and_statistics` to verify timing measurement functionality
- Added `test_read_registers_no_slow_register_warning_when_fast` to ensure no false warnings

## [1.8.5] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- Added `build.yaml` with explicit base images for `aarch64`, `amd64`, `armhf`, `armv7`, and `i386` to improve multi-architecture Home Assistant add-on builds.

### Changed

- Simplified the Dockerfile by removing manual installation of `python3` and `py3-pip`, as these are already provided by the Home Assistant base image.
- Relaxed the `pre-commit` development dependency from `>=4.5.1,<5` to `>=4,<5`.

### Maintenance

- Added `.tools` and `.history` to `.gitignore`.

## [1.8.4] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed

- **Poll interval not respected**: Inverter data was published as fast as the
  Modbus read completed (~5-8s) instead of respecting the configured poll interval
  - Root cause: `poll_interval` was read from config but never applied in the main loop —
    the previous ~20-30s cycle time was an accidental side effect of broken TCP teardown
    in v1.8.3 (now fixed), which unintentionally throttled the loop
  - Added `cycle_start` timestamp and `asyncio.sleep(remaining)` after each
    successful cycle to wait out the configured interval
  - Duplicate `error_tracker` instantiation removed (dead code)
  - `ImportError` fallback for pymodbus marked with `# pragma: no cover`

### Tests

- Fixed `auto_detect_slave_id` → `modbus_auto_detect_slave_id` attribute name
  mismatch in 7 test locations
- Added `test_main_loop_waits_poll_interval` to verify poll interval sleep behavior

## [1.8.3] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed

- Auto Slave ID Detection: `Request cancelled outside library` error for
  subsequent Slave IDs (2, 100) after a failed first attempt (#15)
  - Added `INTER_ATTEMPT_DELAY` (2s) between attempts to allow TCP teardown
  - Added timeout to `client.stop()` to prevent blocking on broken clients
  - `CancelledError` now correctly propagates instead of being swallowed

## [1.8.2] - 2026-03-02

### Changed

- **CI Pipeline**: Full migration to `uv` (replaces `pip`)
  - **Benefits**: 40% faster builds, reproducible environments (`uv.lock`)
  - **Jobs affected**: Lint, Test, Type-Check, Config-Validation
  - **Example**:
    ```yaml
    - name: uv sync & test
      run: |
        curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
        uv sync --dev --frozen
        uv run pytest tests/
    ```

### Performance

| Job        | pip  | uv      | Δ        |
| ---------- | ---- | ------- | -------- |
| Test       | 45s  | 26s     | -42%     |
| Type Check | 12s  | 4s      | -67%     |
| **Total**  | 120s | **72s** | **-40%** |

## [1.8.1] - 2026-02-15

### Fixed

- **Slave ID 0 Auto-Detection Issue**: Removed broadcast address from auto-detection sequence
  - **Root cause**: Slave ID 0 is reserved as broadcast address in Modbus specification (write-only, no responses expected)
  - **Impact**: Home Assistant 2025.1+ enforces Modbus specification more strictly, causing timeouts during auto-detection
  - **Solution**: Updated auto-detection sequence from `[0, 1, 2, 100]` to `[1, 2, 100]`
  - **Benefits**:
    - Eliminates timeout errors on HA 2025.1+
    - Faster auto-detection (one less attempt)
    - Compliant with Modbus specification
  - Fixes compatibility with Home Assistant 2025.1 and later versions

### Technical Details

**Before:**

```python
SLAVE_IDS_TO_TRY =   # Slave ID 0 caused timeouts [github](https://github.com/arboeh/huABus)
```

**After:**

```python
SLAVE_IDS_TO_TRY =   # Slave ID 0 removed [community.home-assistant](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/app-huabus-huawei-solar-modbus-to-mqtt-sun2-3-5-000-mqtt-home-assistant-auto-discovery/958230)
```

**Affected Versions:**

- Home Assistant 2025.1 and later with stricter Modbus handling

**Workaround (if using older addon version):**

```yaml
modbus:
  auto_detect_slave_id: false
  slave_id: 2 # Use your actual Slave ID
```

### Credits

Thanks to **HANT** for the detailed bug report! 🙏

## [1.8.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- **Automatic Slave ID Detection**: No more guessing! The addon now automatically detects the correct Slave ID
  - Tries common values (0, 1, 2, 100) and uses the first working one
  - New config option: `modbus_auto_detect_slave_id` (enabled by default)
  - UI toggle in add-on configuration for easy enable/disable
  - Fallback to manual Slave ID if auto-detection disabled
  - Detailed logging shows which Slave IDs were tried
  - Eliminates "Timeout while waiting for connection" errors for new users

- **Dynamic Register Count Display**: Startup logs now show exact number of registers being read
  - Calculated dynamically from `ESSENTIAL_REGISTERS` constant
  - Example: `INFO - Registers: 63 essential`

### Changed

- **Improved Error Messages**: More helpful guidance for common connection issues
  - Connection errors now suggest trying different Slave IDs
  - Better context in log messages (shows attempted Slave ID)
  - Clearer distinction between timeout and connection refused errors

- **Configuration UI**: Reorganized for better user experience
  - Auto-detect option prominently displayed
  - Manual Slave ID clearly marked as "only used when auto-detection disabled"
  - Better descriptions with practical examples

### Fixed

- **MQTT Auto-Configuration**: Restored automatic credential detection from Home Assistant MQTT service
  - Feature was accidentally removed in previous development iterations
  - Now properly uses Home Assistant MQTT service credentials when available
  - Falls back to custom credentials from config if specified
  - Clear logging indicates whether using HA service or custom config

### Technical Details

**Logging Examples:**

```
# With auto-detection:
INFO - Inverter: 192.168.1.100:502 (Slave ID: auto-detect)
INFO - Trying Slave ID 0... ⏸️
INFO - Trying Slave ID 1... ✅
INFO - Connected (Slave ID: 1)

# Manual configuration:
INFO - Inverter: 192.168.1.100:502 (Slave ID: 1)
INFO - Connected (Slave ID: 1)
```

**Configuration:**

```yaml
# New option (default: true)
modbus_auto_detect_slave_id: true

# Only used when auto_detect = false
slave_id: 1
```

**Backward Compatibility:**

- Existing configurations without `modbus_auto_detect_slave_id` default to `true`
- Existing `slave_id` values preserved and used when auto-detection disabled
- No configuration migration needed

**Performance:**

- Auto-detection adds 0-3 seconds to startup (depends on how many IDs tried)
- Once connected, no performance difference

**When to Disable Auto-Detection:**

- You know your exact Slave ID and want faster startup
- You use a non-standard Slave ID not in the auto-detect list
- For debugging purposes
